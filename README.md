Datasets :: InformationIsPower
==================
Datasets provided on the exeResearch LLC website ( www.exeResearch.com ).

The validation of newly designed methods and protocols relies on the
ability to apply them to known datasets. While one or even several
datasets cannot account for all instances, knowing how new ideas
compare to previous results is a first step. Some of the provided
datasets are well known while others are from research conducted at
[exeResearch LLC](http://exeResearch.com).


##CoMFA Steroid Benchmark Dataset
This steroid dataset was made famous by the original CoMFA article (*J
Am Chem Soc*, 1988, **110**(*18*), pp5959-5967. DOI:[10.1021/ja00226a005](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja00226a005)). The
provided steroid dataset is the corrected version by Eugene A Coats
(*Perspect Drug Discovery Des*, 1998, **12/13/14**,
pp199-213. DOI:[10.1023/A:1017050508855](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1017050508855)).


##Selwood Dataset
The Selwood dataset is well known to those interested in genetic
algorithms and QSAR modeling. This is the Selwood dataset used in the
Rogers and Hopfinger Genetic Function Approximation (GFA) study (*J
Chem Inf Comput Sci*, 1994, **34**(*4*), pp854-866. DOI:[10.1021/ci00020a020](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ci00020a020));
originally curated by Selwood *et al*. (*J Med Chem*, 1990, **33**(*1*)
pp136-142. DOI:[10.1021/jm00163a023](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jm00163a023)).


##Oxime Dataset
The oxime dataset contains 17 oximes with percent reactivation values
for cyclosarin, sarin, tabun, and VX. The conformation and AM1-bcc
atomic charges are provided as a stacked MOL2 file and the
conformations and the percent reactivation values are provided in a
SDFile. This dataset is from Esposito *et al*. *Chem Res Tox*, 2014,
**27**(*1*), pp99-110. DOI:[10.1021/tx400350b](http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/tx400350b)
